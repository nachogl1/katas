# Katas Playground

I chose to have all my katas in the same repo using Trunk-Based development. They are independent exercises, and I find
it easier
to update this way. On top of that, I have one source of truth to go when I have doubts, or I have new ideas.

## Key takeaways

- It can be useful to instead of using camelCase in the tests, to use snake case but separating the **given_when_then**
  subsections
  for quicker feedback loop
- I find **Starting Step Tests** interesting
